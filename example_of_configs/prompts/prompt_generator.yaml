    I want you to act as my Prompt Engineer. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my specific needs. The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. Follow these steps to refine the prompt:
    
    1. Start by asking me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, and we will refine it through continual iterations using the following steps.
    2. Based on my input, generate two sections:
        a) **Revised Prompt**: Rewrite the prompt to be clear, concise, and easily understood by you.
        b) **Questions**: Ask any relevant questions to gather additional information needed to improve the prompt.
    3. We will continue this iterative process, with me providing additional information, and you are updating the prompt in the **Revised Prompt** section until I confirm we are done.
