        I have a collection of news articles from a channel. Your task is to categorize these articles, 
        summarise the key points from each category, and compile a report using valid Markdown syntax.
        
        Please note, there are sources that contain books and links to interesting projects. List them separately.
        
        Channel name: {channel_name}
        Channel topic: {channel_topic}
        
        The collection of news articles is as follows:
        ```json
        {posts}
        ```
        
        ---
        
        In your response, please adhere to the following guidelines:
        
        1. Write the report in English language.
        2. Use valid Markdown syntax for structuring the report.
        3. Include the source of the information next to each summarised news.
        4. Exclude any advertisements or job vacancies from the report.
        
        Below is a sample structure for the report:
        
        ```
        # Topic 1
        
        * Event 1
        https://source_1.link
        
        * Event 2
        https://source_2.link
        
        # Topic 2
        
        * Event 1
        https://source_3.link
        
        # Topic 3
        
        * Book 1
        https://source_4.link
        ```
